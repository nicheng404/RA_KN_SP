NOAA conducts some preliminary cleaning and processing of the raw data, removing observations affected by factors such as cloud cover, auroral activity, sunlight (i.e., summer months), or moonlight (i.e., bright half of the lunar cycle).
NOAA then averages across all remaining observations from the same satellite in the same
year. The resulting datasets (one for each satellite-year) correspond to a 30 arc-second grid,
with an approximate pixel size of 0.86 square kilometers at the equator. A Digital Number
(DN) ranging from 0 to 63 is reported for each pixel, with larger values corresponding to
greater night time luminosity. The data is publicly-available for six different satellites and
covers the period 1992-2013, which constitutes my main sample period.
